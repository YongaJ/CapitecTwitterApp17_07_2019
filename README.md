# CapitecTwitterApp17_07_2019
Capitec Twitter App from txt files with CRUD functions
The 'API' folder has the app running the API service. 
The 'HitAPI' folder is a windows forms, that utilises the API in a graphical format, as I'm not great with front-end designs. 
The 'CapitecPayRoll' folder is the web app(MVC), where docs are uploaded and small functionality. 
The CapitecPayRoll.sln solution is the main solution for all 3 apps. 

NB: I DID THE TWITTER APP, BUT MY FOLDER SAYS 'CAPITECPAYROLL', my mistake. I had the pay roll system in mind. :-) 

For logging, I implemented log4net, which I find easier and it's free. 

Required packages to run the app: 
log4net (Verion:2.0.0) 
bootstrap (Verion:3.0.0) 
jQuery.filedrop (Version: 1.0.1)
jQuery. (Version: 1.10.2)


I will highly suggest changing the location to your local location for viewing the files of user.txt and tweet.txt. Locations are currently in webconfig to make it easy for changing.
